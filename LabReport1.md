When the command was run, the working directory was the home directory as indicated by the `~` symbol with nothing following. Since I ran it with no arguments, there is nothing after the `cd` in the command line. The `cd` command changes directories, but since there was no argument, the directory did not change and I remained in the home directory. This is not an error as I did not provide any arguments, so I remained in the same directory as when the command was run.

## Using with a path to a directory as an argument

When the command was run, the working directory was the home directory as indicated by the `~` symbol with nothing following. The argument I used was the `lecture1` directory. Since I used the `cd` command to change directories, after running the command I changed directories into the `lecture1` directory. This is not an error as the expected outcome of the `cd` command is to change directories into the one used as an argument.

When the command was run, the working directory I had was the `lecture` directory, as indicated with the text after the `~` symbol. My output after running the command with the text file `es-mx.txt` was a message saying that no such directory or file was found.
